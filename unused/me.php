<span class="section">About me</span>
<p>
I was born in New York City and raised in Kansas and Dallas.  I attended Richardson High School in Richardson, Texas and moved on to the University of Texas at Austin where I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.  I intend to obtain a Masters degree in Software Engineering in the near future.
<p>
I love to code.  My favorite mode of development is Object Oriented Programming, but I also have experience with procedural, functional, or relational techniques.  I've usually chosen breadth of technology over depth.

<p>
I am available for contract work on Mantis for $50/hr.  I am currently employmed.<p>

<span class="section">Projects</span>
<p>
Like most people who code as a passion, I've worked on many, many projects.
<p>
In high school I wrote a simple DOS program that would create FILE_ID.DIZ files for various tracked music files.  These would go into ZIP files to help BBSes keep track of the actual contents of the ZIP file.  I also wrote a simple batch file processing utility for moving, renaming, compression, and deletion.
<p>
One of my favorite programs was a graphical simulation of the classic Towers of Hanoi problem.  We figured out a non-recursive solution to the problem and went about implementing it graphically.  We used animated cranes, magnets and pulsating color palettes to make watching the repetitive process amusing.
<p>
I began programming in Windows with Delphi.  I wrote several tools for mp3 cataloging, id3 tag editing, file management, file sorting, file renaming, etc.  Eventually, I helped some friends write a role-playing game for the Macintosh.  I created a map/item/character editor along with some file synchronization tools.
<p>
I've had exposure to Scheme, Haskell, Prolog, and LISP.  I don't really think I'll ever use these languages but I'm grudgingly glad I had some experiences with them.  My college projects included a Java web server and distributed web cache, a rewrite of malloc(), a filesystem simulation, Java applets, an OpenGL space flight simulator, and a raytracer.
<p>
Since then I've moved into web programming, something I used to swear I wouldn't do.  Mantis is my first real foray into PHP (and Python).
<p>
My ideal project would be game programming.  After that, anything to do with creative tools such as graphics or music.  However, more than the content, I'm drawn in by any well-structured programming project.  This requires strong focus, design, good planning, and top-notch execution.  I like to help glue projects together and make tasks simpler and more efficient.  Typically, I do lots of work on back-end and support software that assists the development of the primary project.
