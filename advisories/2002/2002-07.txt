  1. Introduction

Mantis is an Open Source web-based bugtracking system, written in PHP, which
uses the MySQL database server. It is being actively developed by a small
group of developers, and is considered to be in the beta stage.

  2. Summary / Impact analysis

Mantis allows administrators to set certain projects private. This restricts
its access to users who have been explicitly added to that project.

There was a bug in Mantis which caused the 'View Bugs' page to list bugs from 
both public and private projects when no projects were accessible to the user.
This has been patched in Mantis 0.17.5.

'View Bugs' lists only a summary of the bugs. This does not include
additional information such as the steps to reproduce the bug and any
bugnotes that may have been added.

  3. Affected versions

The following versions are affected:
  Mantis 0.17.4a
  Mantis 0.17.4
  Mantis 0.17.3
  Mantis 0.17.2
  Mantis 0.17.1
  Mantis 0.17.0

  4. Workaround / Solution

Mantis 0.17.5 patches this problem. Users are suggested to upgrade to this version 
when possible.

If an upgrade is not possible, the following patch (against Mantis 0.17.4a)
will close the vulnerability (although uncleanly):
