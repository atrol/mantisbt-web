<span class="section">Installation</span>
<p>We offer installation and setup for a fee.</p>

<br />
<span class="section">Customization</span>
<p>Our services are available to customize MantisBT to suit your needs.  We design customizations with a special focus on our customers ability to easily upgrade to future versions of MantisBT.  This is done by putting the generic requirements into MantisBT core and by adding extension points that can are used to implement customer specific requirements.</p>
<p>We recommend you use MantisBT for a short period to see what changes would best fit your organization.  We may also be available for other web related projects.</p>
