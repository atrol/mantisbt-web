<p>
You can find me on IRC in #mantishelp on EFnet.  I've started inhabiting it as of July 12, 2001.  Keep in mind that I'm probably not going to be around most of the daytime hours and often not until late in the evenings (US CST).  You can chat me up to just talk, ask about Mantis, discuss development, etc.
<p>
I've also taken up residence on the <a href="http://www.openprojects.net/">Open Projects Network (OPN)</a>
<p>
The official <a href="http://www.efnet.org/">EFnet</a> website has some links to IRC programs as well as a list of servers that you can use.  I use <a href="http://www.mirc.com/">mirc</a>.
<p>
I'm open to IRCing on another network if anyone has good suggestions.  EFnet has the unfortunate tendency to get packet spammed by script kiddies resulting in poor access.
