<span class="section">What is it?</span>
<p>
Mantis is a web-based bugtracking system.  It is in active development and is considered beta (although fairly stable).
<p>
It is written in the <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> scripting language and requires the <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> database and a webserver.  Mantis has been installed on Windows, MacOS, OS/2, and a variety of Unix operating systems.  Almost any web browser should be able to function as a client.  It is released under the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a> (GPL).
<p>
Mantis is free to use and modify.  It is free to redistribute as long as you abide by the distribution terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>.
<p>
<span class="section">History</span>
<p>
Mantis started as an internal bug tracking tool for a pet project (video game).  Good, free packages were lacking at the time so a bugtracker was written.  Since then, Mantis has been totally re-written and make it available to the public.
<p>
<span class="section">Goals</span>
<p>
The goals for this project are to produce and maintain a lightweight and simple bugtracking system.  Additions of complexity and/or features are modular and configurable so that users can be shielded from unwanted clutter.
<p>
The product is designed to be easily modifiable, customizable, and upgradeable.  Anyone with intermediate PHP and MySQL experience should be able to customize Mantis to suit their needs.
