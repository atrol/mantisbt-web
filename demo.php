      <p>Just as you would expect, we are the first customer of our own product. We use MantisBT to track all
        MantisBT bugs, features, release planning, and pretty much everything that related to helping us drive the
        project forward. </p>

      <p>We encourage you to browse the Mantis Bug Tracker which is publicly viewable to anyone. In doing so you will be
        accessing the MantisBT as an anonymous user with very limited privileges thus missing quite a bit of functionality
        - just keep that in mind.</p>
