<p>You can find us on IRC in #mantishelp on <a href="http://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml">Freenode</a> (previously Open Projects Network).</p>
<p>Idling is a way of life on IRC so do not expect an immediate response.  If you want to be a developer, spending time in IRC is a good way to familiarize yourself with the team.</p>
<p>For Windows users, we recommend <a href="http://www.silverex.org">X-Chat 2 for Windows</a> as an IRC client.</p>
<p>If you don't have an IRC client or not familiar with IRC, then you can use your web browser to join the IRC channel by clicking <a href="http://www.mantisbt.org/cgi-bin/irc/irc.cgi">here</a>.</p>
