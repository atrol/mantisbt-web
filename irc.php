You can find me on IRC in #mantishelp on <a href="http://freenode.info/irc_servers.shtml">Freenode</a> (previously Open Projects Network) or <a href="http://www.efnet.org/index.php?p=servers">EFnet</a>.  Click on the links to find a list of servers.  We seem to have a larger presence on Freenode than EFnet.

Keep in mind that I'm probably not going to be around most of the daytime hours (busy with work?) and often not until late in the evenings (US CST).  Idling is a way of life on IRC.  You can chat me up to just talk, ask about Mantis, discuss development, etc.
